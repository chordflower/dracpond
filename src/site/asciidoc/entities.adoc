== Repository

This is the base entity for the repository entity and represents a place where dracpond, can
resolve and get artifacts from.
It contains the following properties:

* name - string;
* type - enum of local, remote, cached, compound;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* active - boolean;
* publishing_url - string (URL);

== Local Repository

This is a repository that is considered local to dracpond and directly managed by it.
It contains the following properties:

* name - string;
* type - enum of local, remote, cached, compound;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* active - boolean;
* publishing_url - string (URL);
* path - string;
* max-size - uint64;

:NOTE: This is the only type of repository, that allows for uploading artifacts.

== Remote Repository

This is a repository that is considered remote to dracpond and is managed by other system.
It contains the following properties:

* name - string;
* type - enum of local, remote, cached, compound;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* active - boolean;
* publishing_url - string (URL);
* url - string (URL);
* schema - string;
* update_date - Date/Time;

== Cached Repository

This is a remote repository that is cached locally, so that when trying to locate an artifact, dracpond first tries locally and then remotely.
It contains the following properties:

* name - string;
* type - enum of local, remote, cached, compound;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* active - boolean;
* publishing_url - string (URL);
* path - string;
* max-size - uint64;
* url - string (URL);
* schema - string;
* update_date - Date/Time;

== Compound Repository

This is a repository that may combine one or more repositories into a single interface, where the artifacts are
looked in the repositories, following an ascendent order of insertion, meaning that a compound repository, with:

* local-1;
* remote-1;
* local-2;
* remote-2;
* cached-1;
* remote-3;

Will begin to look in local-1, remote-1, local-2, remote-2, cached-1, remote-3 by this order.

:IMPORTANT: If the same artifact is located in two different repositories, for example, local-1 and remote-1, the one in local-1 would be retrieved.

These repositories contain the following properties:

* name - string;
* type - enum of local, remote, cached, compound;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* active - boolean;
* publishing_url - string (URL);
* associated_repositories - array of repositories;

== Artifact

This represents an blob that may be retrieved or uploaded by a dracpond user.
It contains the following properties:

* name - string;
* description - string;
* format - enum of mvn, npm, crate, gem, wheel, go, dart;
* hash - string;
* size - uint64;
* creation_date - Date/Time;
* access_date - Date/Time;
* modified_date - Date/Time;
* deleted_date - Date/Time;
* blob - binary data;
