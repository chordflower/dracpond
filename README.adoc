This is a repository manager/proxy for several services:

* Maven and friends;
* Npm;
* Rust crates;
* Ruby gems;
* Python wheels (pip and friends);
* Golang packages;
* Dart packages (pub);

It is not an objective of dracpond to be a repository for:

* Operating system pakages, this includes:
** Debian packages (apk);
** RedHat RPM's;
** Homebrew bottles;
** etc;
* Git Large File System blobs;

Instead it will focus on programming related packages, like the one described first.

== Coding

Dracpond is written in Kotlin, and uses:

* VertX and friends as a base framework, specifically:
** VertX web for responding to requests;
** VertX config for parsing the configuration file;
** VertX JWT and Ldap auth for authentication (if needed);
** VertX Consul for discovery services;
** VertX RabbitMQ for integration with rabbitMQ queues;
** VertX micrometer for monitoring with JMX and prometheus;
* Jackrabbit oak and friends for storing artifacts;
* ArangoDB for database persistence of users, configurations, etc.
* Vaadin for creating the web interface;
* Various NIO.2 filesystem implementations for comunicating with FTP's, creating cyphered archives;
* Maven as it's build system.
